**Video**: I love teaching prototyping/making courses that combine craft and computation. For example, learn how to build an interactive servo motor that follows your hand using real-time computer vision [here](https://makeabilitylab.github.io/physcomp/communication/handpose-serial.html).

I've had the unique pleasure of teaching a variety of courses from Data Visualization and Introduction to HCI to Ubiquitous Computing and Prototyping Studio. I particularly enjoy technical HCI courses and â€˜makerâ€™ courses that combine craft, computation, and embodied interaction with topics ranging from electronic prototyping and 3D fabrication to introductory signal processing and machine learning.

But generally, I just love teaching! ðŸ˜Š

**Video**: A video snippet from my interactive physical computing textbook introducing capacitive sensing and how to create a custom input controller using bananas and a piano. You can follow the [lesson here](https://makeabilitylab.github.io/physcomp/cpx/#lesson-5-capacitive-sensing) and build your own Banana Piano!

To support remote education during the pandemic and to broaden the impact of my teaching, I made a [physical computing learning website](https://makeabilitylab.github.io/physcomp/)â€”an interactive textbook of sortsâ€”that now has over 620k views from 209 countries.

<!-- Counts: 173,345 from the original Google Analytics; as of Feb 2024, has 332,422 views from GA4; as of Apr 30, has 371,006 views; as of Nov 2024, has 444,225 -->

Feel free to use these materials in your own teaching (I would be honored). These materials have been used in courses at CMU, Stanford, UW ECE, Purdue, OCAD, Wayne State Univ., Univ. of Victoria, [UDIT](https://girardin.medium.com/teaching-emerging-technologies-to-ux-designers-c2d329ff83cd), Sussex, Dundee, and beyond. As one example, I received the following note from a professor:

> Your [website on Intro to Electronics](https://makeabilitylab.github.io/physcomp/) is just fantastic. My students and I are grateful to your intuitive explanations, animations, and step by step problems solving approaches. Your site is exactly what I was looking for. 

My remote teaching practices were also featured by the UW College of Engineering ([story here](https://www.engr.washington.edu/news/article/2022-03-28/learning-outcomes)).
